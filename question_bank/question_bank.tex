% Example Question Bank.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% This is a vanity file, designed to be able to see all the problems in one place.
% The tex code for each problem is actually located in a separate standalone file in 
% the problems directory, sorted by topic.
%
% If you would like to add a new problem to the bank, add a new file to the problems 
% folder and then include it in this file using the \import statement. See the problems 
% already in this file for an example on how to do this. In the standalone tex file, you
% should use the custom problem environment to define your problem. See the other 
% problem files for examples.
%
% These templates allow for rendering assignments either with or without solutions from 
% the same tex file. Simply add the line \newcommand{\showsolutions}{} to the preamble
% (as shown below) and then compile to render with solutions, and comment that line out 
% before compiling to render without solutions.
%
% New homework assignments should go in the homework subdirectory, and should use 
% exactly this format of using \import statements. This makes it so that problems only 
% need to be edited in one place, and then every assignment that uses that problem can 
% receive the changes simultaneously. Any new problems that are written for a particular 
% assignment should be added to the problems folder as a standalone file and then 
% included in the assignment to keep things consistent.
